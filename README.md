# Snake

[Live](snake.tparesi.com)

We all remember Snake on our Nokia phones back in the day. I have created a browser version of Snake as a tribute to my younger years using jQuery and CSS. I set up event listeners to unbind keys while paused, as well as stop scrolling in browser during game play. Modals disallow player to see game screen while paused. Difficulty incrementally increases as more apples are eaten.

Ideas for future game development:

* [ ] Add DB to keep track of high score
* [ ] Add game variations (drunken snake, apple core obstacles, game wrapping)
* [ ] Board size choice
